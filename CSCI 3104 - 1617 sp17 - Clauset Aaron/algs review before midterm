for sure on exam:

if you need the master theorem, he will provide it; cheat sheet at end; just know how to use

if you need to solve non-trivial summations, he will provide it; cheat sheet at end
	should be able to solve by self: sum from i=1 to n of i, sum from i=1 to n of 1/i = lg n

no string alignment on midterm, no largest common substring
	ie knapsack

no extra credit

idk rule applies (rounded down)

be prepared to run an algorithm from class on an input
	input; use x to produce output / what is 16th step stuff; small input sizes though
	ie knapsack algorithm will not be written out for us

WARNING
	there will be a proof question

come up with algorithm, prove correctness, determine asymptotic stuff

no matrix multiplication

rod cutting is fair game!

no lg*n

may see:
	T(n)=AT(n/B)+f(n)
	T(n)=AT(n-B)+f(n)
